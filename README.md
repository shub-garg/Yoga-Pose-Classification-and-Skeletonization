# Yoga Pose Classification using CNN and MediaPipe

This repository contains an implementation of a deep learning approach for yoga pose classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and MediaPipe for body keypoint detection.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a dataset of yoga poses with images processed using MediaPipe.
- **Model Architecture**: Implements a custom CNN model (YogaConvo2d) and compares it with transfer learning models like VGG16, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetMobile.
- **Skeletonization**: Uses MediaPipe to skeletonize images, improving classification accuracy.
- **Training**: Includes training scripts with loss and accuracy tracking.
- **Evaluation**: Provides detailed performance metrics, confusion matrices, and comparison with state-of-the-art models.
